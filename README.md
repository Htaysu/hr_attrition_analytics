## Key Insights

- Employees who travel frequently for business show a higher rate of attrition.
- The majority of attrition occurs within the first 0â€“2 years of employment.

## Conclusion

This Power BI report provides clear insights into the key drivers of employee attrition. Factors such as frequent business travel, lower salary bands, overtime, and short tenure are closely linked to higher turnover. These findings enable HR teams to take proactive steps toward improving retention through data-driven decisions. The interactive dashboards offer a clear and accessible way to monitor trends and support strategic planning.
